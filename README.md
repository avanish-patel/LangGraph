# Components of LangGraph

## State
The state is a shared data structure that holds the current information or context of the entire application.

In simple terms, it is like the application's memory, keeping track of the variables and data that nodes can access and modify as they execute.

## Node
Nodes are individual functions or operations (workflows) that perform specific tasks within the graph.

Each node receives input, process it, and produces an output or updated state.

## Graph
A Graph in LangGraph is the overarching structure that maps out how different tasks (nodes) are connected and executed.

It visually represent the workflow, showing the sequence and conditional paths between various operations.

## Edge
Edges are the connections between nodes that determine the flow of execution.

They tell us which node should be executed next after the current one completes its task.

## Conditional Edge
Conditional Edges are specialized connections that decide the next node to execute based on teh specific condition or logic applied to the current state.

## Start
The start node is a virtual entry point in LangGraph, marking where the workflow begins.

It doesn't perform any operations itself but serves as the designated starting position for the graph's execution.

## End
The End node signifies the conclusion of the workflow in LangGraph.

Upon reaching this node, the graph's execution stops, indicating that all intended processes have been completed.

## Tools
Tools are specialized functions or utilities that nodes can utilize to perform specific tasks such as fetching data from an API.

They enhance the capabilities of the nodes by providing additional functionalities.

Nodes are part of the graph structure, while Tools are functionalities used withing nodes.

## ToolNode
A ToolNode is just a special kind of node whose main job is to run a tool.

It connects the tool's output back into the State, so other nodes can use that information.

## Runnable
A Runnable in LangGraph is a standardized, executable component that performs a specific task within an AI workflow.

It serves as a fundamental building block, allowing for us to create modular system.

## Messages
- **Human Message**: Represents input from a user.
- **System Message**: Used to provide instructions or context to the model
- **Function Message**: Represents the result of a function call
- **AI Message**: Represents responses generated by AI model
- **Tool Message**: Similar to Function message but specific to tool usage

# Sequential Workflow

A sequential workflow defines a predetermined path where tasks are executed one after another in a strict, linear order. This means each step in the workflow must be completed before the next one can begin.

# Parallel Workflow

A parallel workflow refers to a system where multiple nodes or agents are designed to execute simultaneously, each working on a part of the overall task or processing different aspects of the same input data.

# Conditional Workflow

A conditional workflow refers to the ability to create dynamic execution paths within a graph-based application, allowing the flow of execution to change based on specific conditions or outcomes. This is achieved through conditional edges, which enable the system to branch to different nodes depending on runtime data or decisions.
